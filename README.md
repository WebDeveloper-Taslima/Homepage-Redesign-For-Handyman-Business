# Homepage-Redesign-For-Handyman-Business
A modern homepage redesign concept for Stan The Handyman, a local home repair and renovation service provider. The goal was to modernize the look and feel of the existing site while preserving its brand identity, color scheme, and structure â€” creating a design that feels trustworthy, professional, and approachable to local homeowners.
